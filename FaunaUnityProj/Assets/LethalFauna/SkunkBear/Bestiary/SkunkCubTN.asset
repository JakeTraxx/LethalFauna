  displayText: "Skunk Bear\n\nSigurd's danger level: 75%\n\nScientific name: Mephitidae
    ursidae\n\n The Skunk Bear is a large and for the most part, neutral beast, but
    very dangerous nonetheless. The animal produces a strong smell that's toxic to
    inhale and may cause mild illness. Other creatures keep their distance from it
    to avoid the smell, meaning that if you are in proximity to a Skunk Bear, you
    are less likely to be attacked by other outside monsters. There is a chance that
    if you get too close to a Skunk Bear it likely will become aggressive though.
    Skunk bears will wander forest and tundra moons searching for food, their favorite
    being Bee Hives. If you are carrying a beehive or  scrap near a Skunk Bear, the
    Skunk Bear may follow you curiously and become aggressive. They may also try
    to enter your ship to steal scrap so if you see one, or begin to experience the
    effects of its stench, it's best to close the ships doors. Although they are
    mostly neutral in their behavior, their is a chance that a Skunk Bear encounter
    results in an extremely aggressive animal. If you come across a Skunk Bear the
    best way to survive the encounter is to immediately crouch. If you stand during
    an encounter, the Skunk Bear will perceive you as a bigger threat and will more
    likely try to kill you. They are quick for their size, so running isn't a viable
    option unless you are close to the ship and can quickly shut yourself inside.
    Skunk Bears are very hard to kill, but if you manage to do the job it's an impressive
    feat. - Sigurd"
